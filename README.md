# AwakenedAssignment Two
# Silenced Sound


### Some notes
1. I was told that functions in C++ are typically named with underscores (and sometimes PascalCase).
   It's personal preference, but after this assignment I'll be trying to follow the standard.

2. using namepsace std; can lead to naming problems. I need to watch out for that.

3. As of right now, if the user skips the animated-esque typing out of a message,
   my hacky "animation skip" is simply to set the duration of each succeeding letter to 0ms.
   It works, but there's definitely a cleaner way to do it.

4. Code is a MESS. This is because: when I write out some in game text,
   I wanted to have the actual dialogue in a separate file to avoid clutter.
   I never got around to it, so it feels like 20% of the file is code,
   while the rest is just calling functions with some dialogue. Sorry!

5. This is a really short demo! I might wind up doing something real with this.
   Maybe.

6. For fun, a few of my friends on Discord gave me some character names.

    Second evil speaker: Terry
    Lower evil: Zeke
    Head evil: Matt
    Purple: Colton
    First good guy: Nathaniel
    Second good guy 2: David
